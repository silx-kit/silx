Description: Toolbox for X-Ray data analysis - Executables
 The silx project aims at providing a collection of Python packages to
 support the development of data assessment, reduction and analysis
 applications at synchrotron radiation facilities. It aims at
 providing reading/writing different file formats, data reduction
 routines and a set of Qt widgets to browse and visualize data.
 .
 The current version provides :
 .
  * reading HDF5 file format (with support of SPEC file format)
  * histogramming
  * fitting
  * 1D and 2D visualization using multiple backends (matplotlib or OpenGL)
  * image plot widget with a set of associated tools (See changelog file).
  * Unified browser for HDF5, SPEC and image file formats supporting inspection
    and visualization of n-dimensional datasets.
  * Unified viewer (silx view filename) for HDF5, SPEC and image file formats
  * OpenGL-based widget to display 3D scalar field with
    isosurface and cutting plane.
 .
 This uses the Python 3 version of the package.
