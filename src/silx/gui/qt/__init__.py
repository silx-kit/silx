"""Common wrapper over Python Qt bindings:

- `PyQt5 <http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/>`_
- `PySide6 <https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/>`_
- `PyQt6 <https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/>`_

If a Qt binding is already loaded, it will be used.
If the `QT_API` environment variable is set to one of the supported Qt bindings
(case insensitive), this binding is loaded if available, otherwise the
different Qt bindings are tried in this order: PyQt5, PySide6, PyQt6.

The name of the loaded Qt binding is stored in the BINDING variable.

This module provides a flat namespace over Qt bindings by importing
all symbols from **QtCore**, **QtGui**, **QtWidgets** and **QtPrintSupport**
packages and if available from **QtOpenGL** and **QtSvg** packages.

Example of using :mod:`silx.gui.qt` module:

>>> from silx.gui import qt
>>> app = qt.QApplication([])
>>> widget = qt.QWidget()

For an alternative solution providing a structured namespace,
see `qtpy <https://pypi.org/project/QtPy/>`_.
