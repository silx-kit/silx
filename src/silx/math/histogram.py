This module provides a function and a class to compute multidimensional
histograms.


Classes
=======

- :class:`Histogramnd` : multi dimensional histogram.
- :class:`HistogramndLut` : optimized to compute several histograms from data sharing the same coordinates.

Examples
========

Single histogram
----------------

Given some 3D data:

>>> import numpy as np
>>> shape = (10**7, 3)
>>> sample = np.random.random(shape) * 500
>>> weights = np.random.random((shape[0],))

Computing the histogram with Histogramnd :

>>> from silx.math import Histogramnd
>>> n_bins = 35
>>> ranges = [[40., 150.], [-130., 250.], [0., 505]]
>>> histo, w_histo, edges = Histogramnd(sample, n_bins=n_bins, histo_range=ranges, weights=weights)

Histogramnd can accumulate sets of data that don't have the same
coordinates :

>>> from silx.math import Histogramnd
>>> histo_obj = Histogramnd(sample, n_bins=n_bins, histo_range=ranges, weights=weights)
>>> sample_2 = np.random.random(shape) * 200
>>> weights_2 = np.random.random((shape[0],))
>>> histo_obj.accumulate(sample_2, weights=weights_2)

And then access the results:

>>> histo = histo_obj.histo
>>> weighted_histo = histo_obj.weighted_histo

or even:

>>> histo, w_histo, edges = histo_obj

Accumulating histograms (LUT)
-----------------------------
In some situations we need to compute the weighted histogram of several
sets of data (weights) that have the same coordinates (sample).

Again, some data (2 sets of weights) :

>>> import numpy as np
>>> shape = (10**7, 3)
>>> sample = np.random.random(shape) * 500
>>> weights_1 = np.random.random((shape[0],))
>>> weights_2 = np.random.random((shape[0],))

And getting the result with HistogramLut :

>>> from silx.math import HistogramndLut

>>> n_bins = 35
>>> ranges = [[40., 150.], [-130., 250.], [0., 505]]

>>> histo_lut = HistogramndLut(sample, ranges, n_bins)
                           
First call, with weight_1 :

>>> histo_lut.accumulate(weights_1)

Second call, with weight_2 :

>>> histo_lut.accumulate(weights_2)

Retrieving the results (this is a copy of what's actually stored in
this instance) :

>>> histo = histo_lut.histo
>>> w_histo = histo_lut.weighted_histo

Note that the following code gives the same result, but the
HistogramndLut instance does not store the accumulated weighted histogram.

First call with weights_1

>>> histo, w_histo = histo_lut.apply_lut(weights_1)

Second call with weights_2

>>> histo, w_histo = histo_lut.apply_lut(weights_2, histo=histo, weighted_histo=w_histo)

Bin edges
---------
When computing an histogram the caller is asked to provide the histogram
range along each coordinates (parameter *histo_range*). This parameter must
be given a [N, 2] array where N is the number of dimensions of the histogram.

In other words, the caller must provide, for each dimension,
the left edge of the first (*leftmost*) bin, and the right edge of the
last (*rightmost*) bin.

E.g. : for a 1D sample, for a histo_range equal to [0, 10] and n_bins=4, the
bins ranges will be :

* [0, 2.5[, [2.5, 5[, [5, 7.5[, [7.5, 10 **[** if last_bin_closed = **False**
* [0, 2.5[, [2.5, 5[, [5, 7.5[, [7.5, 10 **]** if last_bin_closed = **True**
