Build the Debian 7 package of the ${PROJECT} library.

If the build succeed the directory dist/debian7 will
contains the packages.

optional arguments:
    --help     show this help text
    --install  install the packages generated at the end of
               the process using 'sudo dpkg'
    --python3  use python3 to build the packages
               (it looks to be broken)
