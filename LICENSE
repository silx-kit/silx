The silx toolkit is a software library and one of its goals is not to impose any license to the end user.

Silx follows the permissive MIT license although it may include contributions following other licenses not interfering with the previous goal. Detailed information can be found in the copyright file.

Silx uses the Qt library for its graphical user interfaces.
A word of caution is to be provided.
If users develop and distribute software using modules accessing Qt by means of Riverbank Computing Qt bindings PyQt4 or PyQt5, those users will be conditioned by the license of their PyQt4/5 software (GPL or commercial).
If the end user does not own a commercial license of PyQt4 or PyQt5 and wishes to be free of any distribution condition, (s)he should be able to use PySide2 because it uses the LGPL license.
