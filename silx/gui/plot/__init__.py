"""This package provides a set of Qt widgets for plotting curves and images.

The plotting API is inherited from the `PyMca <http://pymca.sourceforge.net/>`_
plot API and is mostly compatible with it.

Those widgets supports interaction (e.g., zoom, pan, selections).

List of Qt widgets:

.. currentmodule:: silx.gui.plot

- :mod:`.PlotWidget`: A widget displaying a single plot.
- :mod:`.PlotWindow`: A :mod:`.PlotWidget` with a configurable set of tools.
- :class:`.Plot1D`: A widget with tools for curves.
- :class:`.Plot2D`: A widget with tools for images.
- :class:`.ScatterView`: A widget with tools for scatter plot.
- :class:`.ImageView`: A widget with tools for images and a side histogram.
- :class:`.StackView`: A widget with tools for a stack of images.

By default, those widget are using matplotlib_.
They can optionally use a faster OpenGL-based rendering (beta feature),
which is enabled by setting the ``backend`` argument to ``'gl'``
when creating the widgets (See :class:`.PlotWidget`).

.. note::

    This package depends on matplotlib_.
    The OpenGL backend further depends on
    `PyOpenGL <http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/>`_ and OpenGL >= 2.1.

.. _matplotlib: http://matplotlib.org/
