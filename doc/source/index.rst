silx |version|
==============

The silx project aims to provide a collection of Python packages to support the
development of data assessment, reduction and analysis at synchrotron radiation
facilities.
It intends to provide reading/writing tools for different file formats, data
reduction routines and a set of Qt widgets to browse and visualise data.
Silx can be cited by its DOIs referenced on
`Zenodo <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.591709>`_.

The current version (v\ |version|) caters for:

* Supporting `HDF5 <https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_,
  `SPEC <https://certif.com/spec.html>`_ and
  `FabIO <http://www.silx.org/doc/fabio/dev/getting_started.html#list-of-file-formats-that-fabio-can-read-and-write>`_
  images file formats.
* OpenCL-based data processing: image alignment (SIFT),
  image processing (median filter, histogram),
  filtered backprojection for tomography
* Data reduction: histogramming, fitting, median filter
* A set of Qt widgets, including:

  * 1D and 2D visualization widgets with a set of associated tools using multiple backends (matplotlib or OpenGL)
  * OpenGL-based widgets to visualize data in 3D (scalar field with isosurface and cut plane, scatter plot)
  * a unified browser for HDF5, SPEC and image file formats supporting inspection and
    visualization of n-dimensional datasets.

* a set of applications:

  * a unified viewer (*silx view filename*) for HDF5, SPEC and image file formats
  * a unified converter to HDF5 format (*silx convert filename*)
